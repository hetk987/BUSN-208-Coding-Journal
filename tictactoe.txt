Step 1:
 - Add all of the assets
 - Set the asset's settings to make sure that they are usable for our work type
 - Understand the different types of files provided (swift vs swiftUI)

Step 2: 
 - Add all of the models
 - Understand what are the different objects we will need for our project
  - For this project we used GameType, GamePiece, Moves and Players
  - The models folder will pretty much hold all of the constant and type information
  - For our case one of these constant pieces of information was the winning moves. 

Step 3: 
 - Add the logic of starting the application
 - Add all of the global variables we may need using @Published
 - Then add all of the other small variables we may need for game logic
 - Also add what will happen when different options are selected like the different game types

Step 4:
 - Creating the actual loading UI
 - Understand the format and create a framewire either in a professional design or a rough hand drawing
 - Link variables that were created in the previous steps to the inputs that we will collect such as the player information and the game type. 
 - Add styling to the application such as background colors, fonts, padding and borders to make the app and the individual components look better. 

Step 5:
 - Creating the functionality of the actual game
 - Understand the different outcomes that may happen, such as win, lose, draw and when we would need to check for these.
 - Also add logic for how the moves will work and when each player gets to go. 

Step 6:
 - Create the actual tiles and attach the precious step to make it work. 
 - Fix any bugs and add more styling
